# HelloWorld

This is a fork of the orignal 'skeleton project' that the professor built. I've added my own changes (a new image and text, as well as a new background color) to fulfill the project requirements.

## Getting Started

Clone the project and see the lecture video on Canvas under Module 1 for instructions. <br/>
See the completed HelloWorld application here: <br/>
